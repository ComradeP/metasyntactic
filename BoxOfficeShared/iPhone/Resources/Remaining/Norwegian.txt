// Localizers, please read the following instructions before proceeding.
// 
// All text starting with // (including this line) should not be translated.  It is
// purely for providing instructions and hints
// 
// Text that needs to be translated comes in the form:
// 
//     "1 kilometer" = "";
// 
// You will provide the translation on the *right hand side* of the equals (=) sign.
// i.e. if we were translating this to french we would end up with:
// 
//     "1 kilometer" = "1 kilomètre";
// 
// Most cases should be fairly simple, however there can be slight complications.
// Sometimes we will not know a value at this moment, but it will instead be 
// supplied when the program runs.  i.e.:
// 
//     /* i.e.: 2 hours */
//     "%d hours" = "";
// 
// In this case the '%d' will be replaced with a number.  This entity *must* appear
// in your localized text.  Here are some examples of that translated into other
// languages:
// 
// French: "%d hours" = "%d heures";
// Hebrew: "%d hours" = "שעות %d";
// 
// Note that Hebrew switched the order of the order of the words here.
// 
// Finally, you will also see strings of the form:
// 
//     /* %@ will be replaced with a movie showtime.  i.e.: Order tickets for 3:15pm */
//     "Order tickets for %@" = ""
// 
// As with before, the %@ will be replaced by the program when it is running and
// *must* appear in your localized text.  Here is an example of that translated into
// other languages:
// 
// French: "Order tickets for %@" = "Commander un billet pour %@";
// German: "Order tickets for %@" = "für %@ bestellen";
// Hebrew: "Order tickets for %@" = "%@ הזמן כרטיסים עבור";
// 
// Again note that the replacement text can occur wherever you think is appropriate
// for your language.  In cases of replacements i have tried to provide helpful text
// to explain how the values will be replaced.
// 
// If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at:
// cyrus.najmabadi@gmail.com
// 
// Thanks very much!
